# Animation at 15 fps is 680 frames = 45 seconds long.
fps = 15

# However, there aren't strictly 680 frames: because frame "decimation" is 10
# by default, there are approximately 6795 frames. To make things more
# complicated, frames are accessible in numbers ending in 5 for some
# reason. So, for example, frame "795" is close to frame 800, and 800 / 10
# (decimation) / 15 fps = time of 5.33... ; in other words, frame 795 is going
# to be close to "time 5.33... seconds" of the animation.

# Since we are not interested in the initial, "quiet" part of the simulation
# before spiking really begins, we should only use a frames starting at a later
# point in time, like frame 795:
frame_start=795

# Similarly, since we want to keep the movie's file size low, and we don't need
# to show that much of the simulation itself, we will only use the frames up to
# frame 1495 (approximately "time 10 seconds" of the full animation):
frame_stop=1495
