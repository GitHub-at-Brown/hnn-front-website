# hnn-front-website
Code for the new "front"-facing HNN website

Current GitHub Pages rendered website can be found here: <https://github-at-brown.github.io/hnn-front-website/homepage.html>.

### Running scripts:

Any scripts inside `scripts` can be run using the conda environment built for the HNN Textbook website here <https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/textbook>, unless said otherwise in the script.

To run the "prettify" script, once you have activated your environment and you are at the top-level directory of this repository on your local machine, run the following:

```{bash}
$ python scripts/prettify_all_html_files.py
```
